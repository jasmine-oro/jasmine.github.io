										<h1>Onix Work Web Application</h1>
										<p><strong>Onix AS</strong></p>
									</header>
									<p>Date: Apr 2016<br/>Team: PM, BA, IA, Devs, QA<br/>Role: Visual Designer</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p><strong>Onix Work</strong> is a Data and Certificate Archive software for lifting and dangerous work equipment. Users can access Onix Work easily to get equipment's documentation as well as share data to their clients efficiently in the same system.</p>
									<h1>GOALS</h1>
									<p>Summarising the ideas we’d discussed, I developed the following considerations:</p>
									<h1>PROCESS</h1>
									<h2>Step 1: Understanding the challenge</h2>
									<ol>
										<li><strong>Business Context</strong>.<br>To make sure every member in the team have a generic knowledge about the industry, we started some internal kick off meetings, focused on the business context, customers working process and their difficulties. Followed that, ta big problem was pointed: <em>There were many accidents happended to workers which dangerous to their lives and also led the employer companies, their businesses to troubles with the law. It made thiet hai on people, time and money.</em></li>
										<br>
										<li><strong>Problem Statement</strong>.</li>
										<ol>
											<li>Missing equipment inspection led to accidents to the workers.</li>
											<li>Finding, storing and transfering documents between all parties was more complex because of using different systems.</li>
											<li>Delay in delivering documentation decreased the productivities.</li>
											<li>Unconsistentcy in documents forms inscreased errors and less effective during working process.</li>
										</ol>
										<li><strong>Reviewed The Current Product</strong>.<br>We had a look through the current software at the time - <em>Equipment Portal</em> - a window form application which was developed and released several years ago. We went through user flows and some key features it provided.</li>
										<br>
										<li><strong>Analysed Customer Research</strong>.<br>A customer survey and interviews on purpose getting more feedback and customer's expectations were conducted by Sales & Marketing team in Norway showed that most of them wanted the new application has a friendly UI which similar to Microsoft Outlook 365. Here are some reasons:</li>
											<ul>
												<li>They have been using this application for work almost everyday in their working life.</li>
												<li>They feel more confident when using something close with it so they can learn quickly and easily.</li>
											</ul>
										<li><strong>Project's Goals</strong>.<br>Create a web application allows four types of users (Workers / Owners / Suppliers / Inspectors) can manage their works as well as share data to their clients in the same system quickly and effectively.</li>
										<br>
									</ol>
									<h2>Step 2: User personas</h2>
									<p>Going further through the ideas we’d discussed, I summarised 4 personas which have different needs and different goals. The aim was to improve the user experience for each one of them.</p>
