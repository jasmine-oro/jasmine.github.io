								<h1>Weekly Meal Prep</h1>
								<p><strong>Mobile Application</strong></p>
							</header>
							<p>Date: Apr 2019<br/>Personal Project<br/>My role: UI, UX Designer</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic117.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>The WeeklyMealPrep app is great for people who want to spend less time in the kitchen, not only helps you prepare whole meals for the week with easy, delicious recipes but also helps you reach your nutrition goals.</p>
							<h3>Background Information</h3>
							<p>I was inspired to create this app after a conversation with my friend when we were sharing our cooking routines. I recognized that making meals every night was a challenge to us when we all have a busy schedule and commonly coming home late from work. There were several times I found myself staring into the fridge searching for inspiration on what to make, but after a long day at work, the creativity was not on top. The idea of preparing whole meals or dishes ahead of schedule seemed a good option for us in this case. It’s particularly popular amongs busy people because it can save a lot of time and help you stick to your healthy eating plan.</p>

							<h1>Process</h1>
							<p>Survey > User Interviews > User Persona > Sitemap > Wireframe > Visual Design > Usability Test > Prototype</p>
							<h2>User research</h2>
							<h3>The survey</h3>
							<p>I started this user research with the assumption that the user base will be targeted to young people who are students or professional working persons, who live in hustle-bustle cities and have an active life. I developed a survey with Google Forms and distributed it among multiple groups of work profession on Facebook, Whatsapp.</p>
							<p>The purpose was to define:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Users' cooking habits</li>
									<li>What motivates them to cook at home on daily basis</li>
									<li>The basic pain points of them during their cooking process</li>
								</ol>
							<p>The online survey includes <strong> 8 questions</strong>. <br><strong>108 people have completed</strong> and have provided me with quantitative data needed to validate my assumptions.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic69.png" alt="" /></span>
							<figcaption>Summary responses from users participated the survey about Home Cooking</figcaption>
							<br><br>
							<h4>Keys findings:</h4>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Users cooking habit.</strong>
								<br>More than 70% people did the survey mostly are office staffs and students in the 25-35 age who spend 20-40 hours or more per week for working and studying, but still often cook at home from fews time to every day a week.</li>
								<br>
								<li><strong>Motivations.</strong><br>Around 85% of them enjoy cooking at home for some reasons: cost saving, healthy food, having a happy dinner with family, and more. <br>Here are some quotes directly from them:
									<br><i>- "It's safe and hygiene. I also can customize the ingredients based on personal taste."</i>
									<br><i>- "It's healthy and saving a lot. I feel pleasure in cooking and enjoying the food I cooked."</i>
									<br><i>- "Very interesting! I enjoy my time and I am able to share inspriration to friends."</i>
									<br><i>- "It’s better and safer than eating out, also I can improve my cooking skills."</i>
									<br><i>- "It's cost effective and i can cook authentic dishes which i could not easily find in nearby restaurants."</i>
								</li>
								<br>
								<li><strong>Pain points.</strong><br>During the cooking routine, the most common problems that people faced are:
									<br>- It takes lot of time to plan, shop, prepare, and cook > 48%
									<br>- They don't have much time for cooking > 44%
									<br>- Some of them don't know what to cook & how to cook > 13-19%
 								</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>User Interviews</h3>
							<p>To get more qualitative insights about people home cooking process, I conducted <strong>user interviews</strong> with 3 people on some of the research questions:
								<ol>
									<li>What's your typical weekday like?</li>
									<li>Can you describe your food preparation and cooking process?</li>
									<li>How do you make a meal plan?</li>
									<li>What does your grocery shopping list look like?</li>
								</ol>
							</p>
							<p>Besides, I made the naturalistic observation on 2 people, one man, one woman as they perform their daily activities. The goal is to observe their natural behavior, without interrupting them or affecting their routine.</p>
							<h4>The takeaways:</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>All of the people participated in the interviews and observation sessions go to work 30-40hrs per week so they prefer to spend 2-3hrs on the weekend to plan ahead and shop grocery for the upcoming week.</li>
								<li>3/5 do meal preparation and cook right after they get home from the grocery stores. 2/5 just do meal preparation, keep it well in the fridge and cook later in weekdays.</li>
								<li>Some of them use the "Note" mobile application to create a grocery shopping list, meanwhile, the others use a piece of paper. This shopping list is about to keep them stay on track and also avoid wasting food.</li>
								<li>To prepare meals for a week, people have a tendency to pick at least three major proteins dishes they are going to eat first, then combine with veggies, fruit, ... to balance their meal plan.</li>
								<li>They google the cooking recipes or watch Youtube videos for cooking instructions whenever they wanted to try a new dish.</li>

							<h2>User persona</h2>
							<p>Based on the information given from the survey and interviews, I was able to create user persona in order to focus on the target users, ROSY.</p>
							<span class="image main flex"><img src="images/pic78.png" alt="" /></span>
							<figcaption>User persona</figcaption><br>
						
							<p>Next, I conducted a hypothesis journey map based on existing insights and assumptions. This is a great way to visualize and truly understand the customer’s journey as well as a useful tool to design ideal-state experiences for her.</p>

							<h2>Build the product</h2>		
							<h4>Sitemap</h4>
							<p>I created sitemap to see how the navigation of the app should be structured. I wanted to identify where content will be placed in order to get the overview of screens as well as the relationship between them in a system.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic86.png" alt="" /></span>
							<figcaption>Weekly Meal Plan app's structure</figcaption>
							<br>
							<br>
							<h4>Paper Wireframing</h4>
							<p>During the early stages of the design process, I drew paper wireframes and reviewed them several times before going to computer works. By this way, issues are caught earlier. I learnt that I was in started identifying minor and larger issues much sooner than I thought about it before.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic80.png" alt="" /></span>
							<figcaption>Low-fidelity wireframe</figcaption>
							<br>
							<h5>Mid-fidelity Wireframe</h5>
							<p>When paper wireframing was relatively good, I started to transfer these sketches to mid-fidelity of the layouts, using the 8x8 grid system to maintain consistency of elements and balance the design's hierarchy.<br>
							At the same time, I created user flows to make sure I did not forget any steps that it takes for a user to complete a task.</p>
							<p>Overall, the design tries to do two things: <br>1) First, helps users create a meal plan then based on that meal plan, they can generate the corresponding Gocery List to shop ingredients.<br>2) Second, helps users get more cooking inspiration as well as provides them more helpful recipes to follow.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic84.png" alt="" /></span>
							<figcaption>Task flow #1: Creating a Menu Plan for a week then generate the Grocery List for shopping ingredients</figcaption>
							<br>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic85.png" alt="" /></span>
							<figcaption>Task flow #2: Figure out cooking recipes, essential ingredients & instruction</figcaption>
							<br>
							<h4>Visual design</h4>
							<p>In an attempt to attract as many users as possible, I took my time to create a strong visual design, making sure that the visuals are as good as possible. I worked on a style guide, typography, icons and food images.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic87.png" alt="" /></span>
							<figcaption>Hi-fidelity prototype of Weekly Meals Prep app</figcaption>
							<br><br>
							<h2>Usability testing</h2>
							<p>I took these layouts and tested with 3 users, asking them to complete 2 tasks:
								<ol>
									<li>From RECIPE screen, create a meal plan for a week that includes main corses, salad, fruit or dessert then generate the appropriate grocery list for ingredients shopping.</li>
									<li>From SHOPPING LIST screen, create a new grocery shopping list in case you had a ready Meal Plan in your mind already.</li>
								</ol>
							</p>
							<p>By watching them navigate the app, also listening their concerns, I realized there are two common things made them quite confuse.</p>
							<p><strong>Problem #1: Users did not pay attention much to Generate Ingredients feature.</strong><br>When users finished adding dishes to create a Meal Plan, at MEAL PLAN DETAILS screen, instead of Generate Ingredients right away in order to quickly create Grocery Shopping List, most of them have a tendency to switch to GROCERY to pick the essential ingredients. It meant the action [Generate Ingredients] was ignored. Users did not pay attention much to that fucntion. As they said, since it's too small to catch the eyes.</p>
							<p><strong>=> Solution:</strong> Move [Generate Ingredients] to the bottom of screen and transformed it to an actionable button. This way, users were instructed what's the next step was supposed to do.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic88.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p><strong>Problem #2: Users were confuse about which shopping list was the one they had just created.</strong><br>After finished creating a grocery shopping list, users didn't know exactly wether the list they had just created was saved sucessfully or not? Since there wasn't different at all from the old items with the new one. The layout was just basically black and white and the new one just looks the same as others.</p>
							<p><strong>=> Solution:</strong> Use indication colors to distinguish the items in the list. Besides, highlighted the one that has been creating, unless users tap to see it.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic89.png" alt="" /></span>

							<h4>Final prototype</h4>
							<br><br>
							<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://marvelapp.com/573269i?emb=1&iosapp=false&frameless=false" width="300" height="572" allowTransparency="true" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
							<h4 class="devider">...</h4>
							<h1>Conclusions</h1>
							<p>It was really rewarding to create a solution to a problem on my own. I got to navigate almost all of the UX process solo and learn my strengths and weaknesses along the way. Understanding the UX process through a user-centered lens has given me a great amount of information needed to design apps with the user in mind by understanding the motivations and desires of them.</p>
